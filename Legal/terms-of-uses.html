        <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms of Use are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which WizWeb operates. Any disputes
            arising from these terms will be resolved in the appropriate courts in that jurisdiction. If any provision
            of these terms is found to be unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full
            force and effect.</p>

        <h2>11. Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>Any disputes related to these Terms of Use shall first be attempted to be resolved through informal

            binding arbitration in the jurisdiction in which WizWeb operates. Both parties agree to waive any right to
            participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.</p>

        <h2>12. Modifications</h2>

            after any changes to the Terms of Use constitutes your acceptance of those changes.</p>
